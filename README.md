Greetings! I am Emily, a rising senior majoring in Computer Science based in New York City, NY. Some of my hobbies are playing games with friends, music, anime and learning new things!

I am a proud, free-flowing Asian American woman with a side of ENFP eccentricity, asexuality ⚫️⚪️💜, and aphantasiac struggles.

This summer I will be diving more deeply into frontend development as well as the computer science and design intersection so any advice or insight is welcome!
